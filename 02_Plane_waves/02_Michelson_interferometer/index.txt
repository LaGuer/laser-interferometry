In a Michelson interferometer an incoming laser beam is split into two
parts by a
beam splitter. The now two beams propagate along two perpendicular
arms, each ending with a mirror. The beam are reflected back
towards the beam splitter where the two beams are
recombined. Depending on the length difference of the arms, the beams
either enhance or attenuate each other. The Michelson interferometer
is one of the best length measurement devices known by mankind.
