    "This section aims to outline both the philosophy of Pykat and provide an overview of how it intends to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pykat is an object-orientated Python wrapper for the Finesse binary. It aims to simplify the usage of Finesse for more complex simulation tasks. For example:\n",
    "* Optimisation problems\n",
    "* Chained simulations, feeding results of one simulation into the next\n",
    "* Advanced plotting of outputs\n",
    "* Automation of simulations\n",
    "* Running simulations on clusters\n",
    "* Using IPython/Jupyter notebooks to document simulation tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "Interacting with Finesse to run more complicated simulation tasks using just the builtin plotting and output functionality quickly becomes limiting. In such cases it is usual to want to loop, repeat or modify simulations as you experiment and better understand the problem. Pykat has evolved to make such tasks easier."

    "There are three distinct features in the Pykat-Finesse interaction that will be referred to throughout this description:\n",
    "* The **Model**: A particular optical setup or layout that \n",
    "* The **Simulation**: When a Finesse model is run to generate a particular output\n",
    "* The **Output**: The data generated by a particular simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "The **model** of the interferometer is that which you design and generate using Finesse commands. This will be a collection of optical components that represents the system in general. It does not assume anything about what data will be produced or detectors used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a model is created you can design the type of **Simulation** that you wish to run. This requires you to first decide what type of output you want to see, thus what detectors you need to add to extract optical, mechanical or other values. Along with this the changing variable must also be set using the xaxis setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, a simulation is taken and you **run** it. This takes all the settings and configuration of the simulations and passes it to the Finesse binary. This then runs the simulation and generates various data files containing the **output** result. Pykat parses these data files into more friendly formats for the user to enable plotting or further processing of the output."
