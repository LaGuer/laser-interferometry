FINESSE is a frequency domain simulation software for laser
interferometry, specialised at gravitational wave laser
interferometry. It is actively being used for commissioning and design
for gravitational wave detectors. In this folder you find a brief (but
less brief than this text)
explanation of what FINESSE is.
