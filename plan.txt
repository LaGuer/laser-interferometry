* Outside files, which should bee seen and read first:

- Intro in PDF: Should explain the aim of this school, which people it is aimed at, why they should look at the material, introduction to gravitational wave laser interferometry. And very briefly answer: why numerical modelling with Finesse? Why PyKat? Why in notebook format?

- Installing instructions in PDF: downloading, installing, find online information.

* Background “physics” that wee need to cover (i.e. point people to reading material) during the introduction notebooks, or possibly in a PDF-document.

- Frequency domain
- Complex representation of the electric field
- Amplitude as sqrt(W)
- Laser
  - Coherence
  - Collimated beam
  - Monochromatic field or single frequency field
  - Paraxial approximation
- Sideband picture

2. Plane waves
   (a) Fabry-Perot cavity

       - Resonance (Missing table of content)
         * Powers vs. cavity mirror tuning
	 * Powers vs. cavity space length
	 * Offset laser freq. and repeat the previous task
         * After: 
	   Played with a cavity and the concept of resonance
	   Experienced difference between length and tuning
           Experienced how Finesse defines length in terms of phases

       - Free spectral range (Work in progress)
         * Sweep laser frequency
         * Change cavity length, and repeat
	 * Change lambda0 and repeat

       - Line width (Work in progress)

       - Finesse of a cavity (Work in progress)
         * Aim for an intuitive picture in terms of roundtrip loss or Q-value.
         * FSR/FWHM
         * Play with reflectivity and cavity lengths.
         * After: Seen how the length and reflectivity affects the Finesse
                  Know roughly with which factor a cavity with on resonance 
		  with a given Finesse amplifies the power/amplitude.

       - Over coupled, under coupled, and impedance matched. (Work in progress)

   (b) Michelson Interferometer

       - Arm length difference (Missing table of content)
	 * Show response to arm length difference in tunings
	 * Calibrate setup to the dark fringe (initially on bright fringe)
	 * Offset differential arm tuning to yield 10 mW output.
	 * Plot power vs. macroscopical arm length difference.
	 * Change carrier frequency and repeat previous task
	 * Offset laser freq. and repeat previous task
