1. Introduction
   (a)  PDF: Introduction to gravitational wave laser interferometry. 
	     And very briefly: why numerical modelling with Finesse, why PyKat, why notebooks. 
   (b)  PDF: Installing instructions
       	- downloading, installing, find online information.
   (c) Ipython notebook
           * Basic notebook usage.
           * After: Have seen how to write code
		    Have seen how to write markdown
		    Have seen how to show figures
		    Have seen how to change colours, fonts etc.
		    Have seen how to make inline plots
   (d) PyKat
       - Motivation, usage
	   * Facilitate advanced Finesse usage
           * Python free and open source
           * Extended to perform computations outside Finesse.
       - Basic commands
	   * How to create the kat-object 
           * Parse Finesse code 
           * Run the simulation.
	   * Plot results
   (e) Finesse
       - Motivation, usage.
       - Basic commands, components, nodes
2. Plane waves
   (a) Fabry-Perot cavity
       - Lengths, tunings, and resonance
	 * Change cavity length
         * Change cavity tuning
         * Plot intra-cavity power
         * After: Know difference between length and tuning
                  Know the concept of resonance
       - Free spectral range
         * Sweep tuning or frequency
         * Change cavity length, and repeat
       - Finesse of a cavity
         * Aim for an intuitive picture in terms of roundtrip loss or Q-value.
         * FSR/FWHM
         * Play with reflectivity and cavity lengths.
         * After: Seen how the length and reflectivity affects the Finesse
                  Know roughly with which factor a cavity with on resonance 
		  with a given Finesse amplifies the power/amplitude.
       - Over coupled, under coupled, and impedance matched.
   (b) Circular cavity
   (c) Modulation, demodulation, and optical beats
       - Phase modulation
       - Frequency modulation
       - Amplitude modulation
       - Optical beat
       - Demodulation
   (d) Controlling Fabry-Perot cavity
       - PDH
         - Creating an error signal
         - Optimising the error signal (demodulation phase)
         - Gain of error signal
         - Forming locking loop
   (e) Michelson Interferometer
       - The beam splitter
       -
3. Hermite-Gaussian beams

   (b) Fabry-Perot cavity
       - Mirror curvature and stability (definition of g and m values)
       - Cavity eigenmode
       - Higher order modes
       - Cavity scan and the effect of the Gouy-phase
       - Mode mismatch
       - Misaligned cavity
